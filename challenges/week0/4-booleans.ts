/*
There are only two Boolean values --- true, or false.

Booleans are quite powerful because they give you flexibility to handle
many situations. That said, though they seem simple Booleans often create some
of the most confusing bits of code because they're not always
clear - especially when chained together.

Below you'll see 7 values and 7 questions. Each question returns a Boolean value
by either comparing or examining one or more of the 7 available values.

In the answers section below, write either true or false based on the corresponding question.

// Example: Determine if Drake's new album 'Honestly, Nevermind' is mid based on the maiden count and ratio,
//          Then, set exampleAnswer to the correct value
export const maidens = 0
export const ratio = true
export const isHonestlyNevermindMid = ratio && maidens === 0
export const exampleAnswer = true

const valueOne: any = 13
const valueTwo: any = '13'
const valueThree: any = 16
const valueFour: any = 'seventeen'
const valueFive: any = 'eighteen'
const valueSix: any = 0
const valueSeven: any = false

// hints to the right ----------------------->
export const questionOne = valueOne == valueTwo // double equality vs triple equality
export const questionTwo = !!valueSix // double-bang operator
export const questionThree = valueTwo !== valueOne // non-equality in javascript
export const questionFour = valueFive < valueFour // comparators
export const questionFive = !valueSeven // bang operator
export const questionSix = !valueSeven || valueOne > valueThree // double pipe
export const questionSeven = !valueSeven && valueThree < valueOne // double ampersand
